## Understanding NiWrap and Boutiques

NiWrap is a collection of Boutiques descriptors for neuroimaging tools. These descriptors are used by the [Styx](https://github.com/styx-api/styx) compiler to generate type-safe language bindings in Python, TypeScript, and R.

### What is Boutiques?

[Boutiques](https://boutiques.github.io/) is a JSON-based descriptive standard for command-line tools. It allows you to specify:

- Command-line arguments and their types
- Input and output files
- Dependencies between parameters
- Container configurations
- And much more

Boutiques descriptors serve as the "source of truth" for NiWrap, defining how each neuroimaging tool works and how users can interact with it.

> **Note:** For a comprehensive guide to Boutiques concepts and advanced usage, see the [Boutiques Guide](../boutiques_guide/) section of this documentation.

Here's a simplified example of a Boutiques descriptor:

```json
{
  "name": "example_tool",
  "description": "An example neuroimaging tool",
  "tool-version": "1.0.0",
  "command-line": "example_tool [INPUT] [OUTPUT] [OPTIONS]",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "input_file",
      "name": "Input file",
      "type": "File",
      "value-key": "[INPUT]",
      "optional": false
    },
    {
      "id": "output_file",
      "name": "Output file",
      "type": "String",
      "value-key": "[OUTPUT]",
      "optional": false
    },
    {
      "id": "verbose",
      "name": "Verbose output",
      "type": "Flag",
      "command-line-flag": "-v",
      "optional": true
    }
  ],
  "output-files": [
    {
      "id": "output",
      "name": "Output file",
      "path-template": "[OUTPUT]"
    }
  ]
}
```

This descriptor defines a tool with an input file, output file, and a verbose flag. The Styx compiler transforms this into type-safe language bindings that users can call from their preferred programming language.

## Repository Structure

The NiWrap repository is organized as follows:

```
niwrap/
├── build-templates/      # Templates used during the build process
├── build.py              # Main build script for generating language bindings
├── descriptors/          # Boutiques descriptors for each tool
│   ├── afni/             # AFNI tools
│   ├── ants/             # ANTs tools
│   ├── fsl/              # FSL tools
│   └── ...
├── extraction/           # Tools for extracting parameter information
├── packages/             # Package configuration files
├── schemas/              # JSON schemas for validation
├── scripts/              # Utility scripts for maintaining descriptors
├── tests/                # Tests for descriptors
└── update_readme.py      # Script to update the README with current tool coverage
```

## Development Environment Setup

Setting up a proper development environment will make contributing to NiWrap more efficient.

### Basic Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/styx-api/niwrap.git
cd niwrap

# Install required dependencies using pip
pip install pytest
pip install git+https://github.com/styx-api/styx.git
```

> **Note:** A formal `requirements.txt` file may be added in the future. For now, installing pytest and the Styx compiler from GitHub should be sufficient for most development tasks.

### VSCode JSON Schema Validation

Visual Studio Code users can enable automatic validation and autocompletion for Boutiques descriptors by configuring JSON schema validation:

1. Create or open `.vscode/settings.json` in your NiWrap repository
2. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
    "json.schemas": [
        {
            "fileMatch": [
                "descriptors/**/*.json"
            ],
            "url": "./schemas/descriptor.schema.json"
        }
    ]
}
```

This setup provides real-time feedback as you edit descriptor files, highlighting potential errors and offering suggestions based on the Boutiques schema.

## Contributing Descriptors

The most common contribution to NiWrap is adding or improving Boutiques descriptors for neuroimaging tools.

### Finding the Right Location

Descriptors are organized by tool suite in the `descriptors/` directory:

```
descriptors/
├── afni/        # AFNI tools
├── ants/        # ANTs tools
├── fsl/         # FSL tools
├── mrtrix3/     # MRTrix3 tools
└── ...
```

Place your descriptor in the appropriate directory, or create a new directory if you're adding a tool from a new suite.

### Fixing an Existing Descriptor

If you've found a bug in an existing tool interface, you'll need to modify its descriptor.

#### Example: Fixing a Parameter Type

Let's say you discovered that the `fractional_intensity` parameter in FSL's BET tool should be a floating-point number between 0 and 1, but it's currently defined as an integer:

```json
// Original descriptor (simplified)
{
  "name": "bet",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "fractional_intensity",
      "name": "Fractional intensity threshold",
      "type": "Number",
      "integer": true,
      "minimum": 0,
      "maximum": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

To fix this, you'd change the descriptor to:

```json
// Fixed descriptor
{
  "name": "bet",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "fractional_intensity",
      "name": "Fractional intensity threshold",
      "type": "Number",
      "integer": false,
      "minimum": 0,
      "maximum": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### Adding a Missing Parameter

If a tool has a parameter that isn't exposed in NiWrap, you can add it to the descriptor.

#### Example: Adding a Missing Flag

Suppose FSL's FAST tool has a `-N` flag for no bias field correction, but it's missing from the descriptor:

```json
// Original descriptor (simplified)
{
  "name": "fast",
  "inputs": [
    // existing parameters
  ]
}
```

You would add the new parameter:

```json
// Updated descriptor
{
  "name": "fast",
  "inputs": [
    // existing parameters
    {
      "id": "no_bias_field_correction",
      "name": "No bias field correction",
      "type": "Flag",
      "command-line-flag": "-N",
      "description": "Turns off bias field correction"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Creating a New Descriptor

If you want to add support for a completely new tool, you'll need to create a new descriptor from scratch.

#### Example: Creating a New Descriptor

Here's a simplified example of creating a descriptor for a fictional tool called `brainanalyze`:

```json
{
  "name": "brainanalyze",
  "tool-version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Analyzes brain structures in neuroimaging data",
  "command-line": "brainanalyze [INPUT] [OUTPUT] [OPTIONS]",
  "container-image": {
    "image": "neuroimaging/brainanalyze:1.0.0",
    "type": "docker"
  },
  "inputs": [
    {
      "id": "input_file",
      "name": "Input file",
      "type": "File",
      "value-key": "[INPUT]",
      "description": "Input neuroimaging file (NIFTI format)",
      "optional": false
    },
    {
      "id": "output_file",
      "name": "Output file",
      "type": "String",
      "value-key": "[OUTPUT]",
      "description": "Output file path",
      "optional": false
    },
    {
      "id": "smoothing",
      "name": "Smoothing factor",
      "type": "Number",
      "value-key": "[OPTIONS]",
      "command-line-flag": "-s",
      "integer": false,
      "minimum": 0,
      "maximum": 10,
      "description": "Smoothing factor (0-10)",
      "optional": true,
      "default-value": 2.5
    }
  ],
  "output-files": [
    {
      "id": "output",
      "name": "Output file",
      "path-template": "[OUTPUT]",
      "description": "Output analysis file"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Working with Package Configurations

The `packages/` directory contains package-level configuration files that define metadata for each neuroimaging tool suite.

### Package Configuration Structure

A typical package configuration file looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "FSL",
  "author": "FMRIB Analysis Group, University of Oxford",
  "url": "https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki",
  "approach": "Manual",
  "status": "Experimental",
  "container": "brainlife/fsl:6.0.4-patched2",
  "version": "6.0.5",
  "description": "FSL is a comprehensive library of analysis tools for FMRI, MRI and diffusion brain imaging data.",
  "id": "fsl",
  "api": {
    "endpoints": [
      {
        "target": "AnatomicalAverage",
        "status": "done",
        "descriptor": "descriptors/fsl/AnatomicalAverage.json"
      },
      // More endpoints...
    ]
  }
}
```

The `status` field in each endpoint entry can have one of three values:
- `"done"`: The descriptor is complete and ready for use
- `"missing"`: The tool is identified but the descriptor is not yet created
- `"ignore"`: The tool should be deliberately excluded from the API

### Updating Package Configurations

When adding or modifying descriptors, remember to update the corresponding package configuration:

1. For a new tool, add a new endpoint entry in the appropriate package file
2. When updating a tool descriptor, ensure its status is set to `"done"`
3. If adding a new tool suite, create a new package configuration file

## Source Extraction

NiWrap's `extraction` directory contains specialized code that modifies the source code of neuroimaging toolboxes to programmatically extract tool information.

### How Source Extraction Works

Source extraction involves:

1. Modifying the original source code of a neuroimaging tool
2. Adding instrumentation to dump tool information during compilation or runtime
3. Capturing this information in a structured format that can be transformed into Boutiques descriptors

This is an advanced contribution area that typically requires:
- Understanding of the tool's source code and architecture
- Programming skills in the language the tool is written in
- Familiarity with the tool's command-line interface

### Using LLM Prompts for Initial Descriptor Creation

The `extraction` directory also contains LLM (Large Language Model) prompts that can help bootstrap the creation of descriptors:

1. Capture the help text of a neuroimaging tool:
   ```bash
   mytool --help > tool_help.txt
   ```

2. Use the provided LLM prompts with a model like Claude or GPT to generate an initial Boutiques descriptor:
   ```
   # Example prompt structure (check extraction directory for specifics)
   Given the following help text for a neuroimaging tool, create a Boutiques descriptor:
   
   [Paste help text]
   ```

3. Review and refine the generated descriptor to ensure accuracy
4. Place the final descriptor in the appropriate directory under `descriptors/`

This approach is particularly useful for tools without structured extraction capabilities and can significantly speed up the initial descriptor creation process.

### For Tool Maintainers

If you're a maintainer of a neuroimaging tool and would like to collaborate on better integration with NiWrap:

- We welcome direct collaboration on source extraction
- This can ensure that your tool's interface is accurately represented in NiWrap
- Contact the NiWrap team through GitHub issues to discuss collaboration opportunities

## Testing Your Changes

After modifying or creating descriptors, you should test them to ensure they work correctly:

1. Use the NiWrap test suite:
   ```bash
   # Run tests for a specific tool
   python -m pytest tests/test_descriptors.py::test_descriptor_validity::test_tool_descriptor
   ```

2. Build the project to check if your descriptors can be processed by Styx:
   ```bash
   python build.py
   ```

> **Note:** NiWrap does not use the original Boutiques runtime (`bosh`). All testing and validation should be done using NiWrap's own build and test utilities.

## Advanced Topics

### Adding a New Tool Suite

If you want to add support for an entirely new neuroimaging tool suite (e.g., adding a new package like SPM or BrainSuite):

1. Create a new directory in `descriptors/` for the tool suite
2. Create descriptors for each tool you want to support
3. Create a new package configuration file in `packages/`
4. Consider creating extraction scripts in the `extraction/` directory

### Creating Helper Scripts

For complex tools, you might need to create helper scripts to streamline the creation of descriptors:

1. Add your script to the `scripts/` directory
2. Document its usage in a comment at the top of the script
3. Reference it in your pull request to help maintainers understand its purpose
